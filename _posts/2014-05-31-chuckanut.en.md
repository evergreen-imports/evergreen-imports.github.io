Will and Mari Kemper are craft beer pioneers, founding the 4th craft brewery in Washington at a time when there were only 20 craft breweries across America. After extensive world travels and brewery consulting work around the globe, they returned to Washington and founded Chuckanut in 2008. In 2009 they won Best Small Brewpub award at the Great American Beer Festival. In 2011 they did it again, winning the award for the Best Small Brewery in America. In an industry where IPA is king and hops rule, Chuckanut dares to be different with their bold and flavorful classic styles and their commitment to perfecting their lagers and ales.
