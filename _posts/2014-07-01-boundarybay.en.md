Before Ed Bennett founded Boundary Bay in 1996, he wanted to make wine. While studying wine at the University of California, he had his first experience with craft beer – and fortunately for us he discovered beer was his true calling. Boundary Bay is one of the largest brewpubs in the United States, and has been ranked several times in the top 25 breweries in the country. Boundary Bay also voted Washington’s best overall brewery in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and best brewpub in 2011 and 2012.
