Founder and head brewer Alex Dittmar opened Airways Brewing company in 2010, combining his two great passions â€“ craft beer and air travel. Like many new brewery owners, Alex was also a homebrewer who turned their hobby into their career. Airways Brewing is a truly small, local brewery, opened with the intent to provide fresh and locally brewed beer to the Seattle suburb of Kent.  Evergreen is happy to bring you these extremely rare beers to Japan so you can also experience the discovery of beers normally available to locals only.
