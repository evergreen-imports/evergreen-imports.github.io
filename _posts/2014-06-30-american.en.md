When brewery owner Neil Fallon decided to open a brewery in 2010, he knew he needed a good brewmaster. As fate would have it, he got a great one. Legendary brewmaster Skip Madsen happened to be available, and was ready for a new challenge - starting a new brewery from the ground up. With 20 years at the helm with some well-noted breweries such as Pike, Big Time, and Boundary Bay, Skip is the father of over 200 beers and has won over 35 major awards in his distinguished career.
